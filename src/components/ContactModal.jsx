          <p>Dr Wilfried MÃ¼ller GmbH takes the protection of your personal data very seriously.</p> <br />
          {/* Add more paragraphs here */}
          <p>We collect and use data strictly in accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and the new German Federal Data Protection Act. We are committed to the confidentiality of your personal data and therefore work within the legal limits. Your personal data is only collected to the extent necessary. Your data will only be forwarded to third parties at your specific request. In addition, data will be forwarded to third parties if required by law.</p><br />
          <p>We only collect personal data that we believe is necessary for order processing or to respond to your enquiry, to fulfil contractual obligations, to ensure the operation of the website, is of legitimate interest to us or for which you have given us your consent to process. The legal basis results from Art. 6 para. 1 a), b), f) GDPR.</p> <br />
          <p>If you give your consent, we collect data to the extent authorised by you. If you contact us via the contact options offered, your details will be stored so that they can be used to process and respond to your enquiry.</p><br />
          <p>If you leave a post or comment on this website, your IP address will be saved. This is for security reasons: if your text violates applicable law, it is necessary to trace your identity.</p><br />
          <p>It is normally possible to use our website without providing personal data. If such personal data is collected on our website, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. This data collected by us will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.</p><br />
          <p>We would like to take this opportunity to point out once again that data transmission over the Internet, for example by e-mail, may be subject to security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties cannot be guaranteed.</p><br />
          <p>We adhere to the principles of data avoidance and data minimisation. We therefore only store your personal data for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes stated here or for the various storage periods stipulated by law. Once the respective purpose no longer applies or these periods have expired, the corresponding data is routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p><br />

Cookies are used to make our website more user-friendly, effective and secure. Some cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the respective cookie. The identifier consists of a string of characters that can be used to assign websites and servers to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This enables the websites and servers visited to distinguish the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. The respective browser can thus be recognised and identified via the unique cookie ID.</p>
<br />
<p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "fashion cookies". They are automatically deleted at the end of your visit, while other cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them. The cookies enable us to recognise your browser on your next visit.</p><br />

The provider is Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Cookies are also used as part of Google Analytics.

By using the internet, you are aware that such analyses are carried out. The data collected to carry out the analysis and optimisation is not of overriding value to the user.</p><br />
<p>However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address will first be truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

<p className="font-bold">Your rights</p>
<p>You will receive information about the personal data we have stored about you at your request. The provision of information is free of charge for you.</p><br />
<p>Your right to information includes notification of the processing purposes, the categories of personal data and the recipients or categories of recipients. If possible, I will inform you of the planned storage period or the criteria for determining this period. This includes the right to receive a free copy of the data obtained in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, whereby the provision of the copy must not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. This includes your right to a direct transfer of the data (right to data portability) to another company, insofar as this is technically possible and legally permissible.</p><br />
<p>In addition, you have the right to request the rectification of your data. This includes the right to completion (completion of the data record itself; completion by means of a supplementary declaration) of incomplete personal data, taking into account the purposes of the processing. If a correction is necessary, we will inform all recipients of the correction at your request.</p><br />
<p>You also have the right to have your data deleted. The deletion will take place immediately upon your request. This does not apply to data that must be stored due to legal regulations or that is still required to process the order. Your data will be deleted when the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies or at the end of a statutory retention period. The right to erasure stipulates that we will ensure that the data is also erased by third parties at your request. For this purpose, the third party will be informed of your name (for the purpose of assignment) and the respective request for deletion of all links, copies and replication.</p><br />
<p>You also have the right to block your personal data stored by us. When blocking, the personal data stored by you is marked in order to restrict its further processing and use. If it is not possible to delete your data due to legal, statutory or contractual retention periods, we will also block your data and inform you of this. If you dispute the accuracy of your data, we will also block it until the accuracy has been finally clarified. If there is reason to assume that your interests worthy of protection will be impaired by the deletion, we will also block the data instead of deleting it.</p><br />
<p>There is also a right to restriction of processing. This applies if the accuracy of the data stored by us is in question.</p><br />
<p>You also have the right to object to the processing. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. In Bavaria, this is the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision, Promenade 27,9 1522 Ansbach, telephone 0981 531300, e-mail poststelle@lda.bayern.de.

<p>Changes to our data protection provisions</p><br />
<p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy from time to time to ensure that it always complies with current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services in the privacy policy. For example, when introducing new services. The new privacy policy will then apply to a new visit.</p><br />
