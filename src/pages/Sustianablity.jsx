            <p className='pt-5'>Particularly in veterinary medicine, where vets are left to their own devices when out in the field and the treatment situations are more demanding, devices must be resilient and easy to repair.

            <p className='pt-5'>Older, used devices are often better suited to the requirements of poor infrastructure in crisis areas or developing countries than new devices. This is because they do not require an internet connection (e.g., for remote maintenance via the internet), they do not need regular technician appointments, and thanks to their high manufacturing quality, they can cope more reliably with harsh conditions – such as fluctuations in mains voltage, which modern devices suffer greatly from.</p>

        of safety</h1>
        <p className='pt-3 text-light'>Currently, many users still think that the use of used medical technology comes at the expense of safety. A myth that we want to dispel. Used medical devices are subject to strict legal safety regulations that are not circumvented.</p>

        <p className='text-light ps-5 pt-5'>They are therefore just as safe as new devices, but often have a higher, more durable quality and a modular design, meaning less effort is required for safe and high-quality maintenance (reliability). For various applications, used medical technology is even much more suitable than sensitive new devices thanks to its greater stability and lower susceptibility to faults.</p>

            <p className='pt-4'>There are many reasons for this. One is social: We want to help our customers to realise their own potential and make it easier for them to set up a practice. We want every doctor to be able to build something of their own, even if they don't have a wealthy background. <br /> <br />Secondly, we want to help shape our world and make a positive difference: We not only want greater equality, so that all patients worldwide can be treated with sound medical technology, but also to counteract today's throwaway mentality.</p>

    <p className='pt-4 pb-3 text-light'>Against the backdrop of globalisation, crisis, and climate change, we have a clear opinion on sustainability in medical technology: The throwaway mentality can no longer continue. That is why we want to contribute to a paradigm shift through our work. It is not necessary that fully functional appliances are simply thrown away for no real good reason. Because they are still able to be useful elsewhere. Particularly in the case of public organisations, which are subject to the principle of economic efficiency, we would like to encourage a rethink.</p>

    <p className='pt-4 text-light'>Fortunately, society as a whole is starting to rethink. Many people want to see a different approach to the use of scarce raw materials and energy. Sooner or later, climate change will therefore also become an important issue in medical technology. Those who want to take precautions now are not only committed to sustainability goals, but can also gain a real market advantage.</p>
